## 👀 About Me  
I’m a passionate web developer with a strong interest in creating dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. Currently diving deep into the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to master full-stack development.

## 🌱 What I’m Learning  
- Building scalable backend systems using **Node.js** and **Express.js**.  
- Crafting interactive and responsive UIs with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
- Integrating and managing databases using **MongoDB**.  
- Deploying applications to cloud platforms for production readiness.

## 💞️ Collaboration Goals  
I’m looking to collaborate on:  
- Open-source projects focused on the MERN stack.
